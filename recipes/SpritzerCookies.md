Spritzer cookies

Butter
Sugar
Flour
Almond extract (or your favourite flavour extract)

This is a sugar cookie that uses the creaming method.
Add softened butter to a mixing bowl. Using the whip attachment, cream the butter and slowly add sugar. Beat until the butter/sugar mixture becomes a light yellow colour.

Add flour slowly in batches and mix until all incorporated.

Put the dough into a cookie press and press out as many cookies as you like onto a cookie sheet lined with foil or parchment paper. Cookies should be a uniform thickness (~1/4" or so). Sprinkle with coloured sugar or decorate with anything edible.

Bake at 350 degrees F for 10 minutes or so or until cookies turn a light golden brown.

Eat.
